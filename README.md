# Hey, I'm Rahul 🐢

Too lazy to write. Have to code.

- 🔭 **Currently working on** P2P software at **[@holepunchto](https://github.com/holepunchto)** and running **[@heart-IT](https://github.com/heart-IT)** — building desktop apps, web platforms, and mobile products. Right now deep in real-time audio over Hypercore and design systems that machines can actually enforce.

- 🌱 **Currently learning** C++20 native audio internals, getting more dangerous with Rust, and encoding design theory from Müller-Brockmann, Vignelli, Armin Hofmann, Emil Ruder, and Christopher Alexander into machine-readable rule systems. Turning books into code, basically.

- 👯 **Looking to collaborate on** P2P applications (Hypercore, Hyperswarm, Pear Runtime), design systems with real governance, React Native performance work, or Ruby on Rails projects that need a hand.

- 🤔 **Looking for help with** finding people who care about both Swiss typography and lock-free data structures. Also Android OEM audio quirks.

- 💬 **Ask me about** design systems, P2P architecture, React Native, Ruby on Rails, why Vignelli was right about everything, or how I mass starred 755 repos and regret nothing.

## What I Build

### Design Systems & Theory
I read design books and turn them into enforceable rule systems — grid construction from Müller-Brockmann, typographic physics from Ruder, spatial integrity from Alexander, structural semantics from Vignelli, compositional mechanics from Hofmann. Not just reading theory — encoding it so machines can validate against it.

## What Drives Me

Good design is good engineering. A grid system is a constraint system. A lock-free pipeline is an aesthetic choice. I don't see a difference between getting typography right and getting thread safety right — both are about respecting the material.

No servers. No middlemen. Build it peer-to-peer or rethink the architecture.
